Next steps:  \n1) We’ll review the photos and confirm whether the return is approved.  \n2) If approved, we’ll send you return instructions. Refunds are issued to the original payment method and are typically processed within 5–10 business days.  \n\nYou also asked about a replacement: our current policy information covers returns/refunds for shipping damage, but doesn’t specify replacements. If you’d prefer a replacement, please reply and we’ll advise what we can do after reviewing the claim.  \n\nBest regards,  \nOlivetto Imports Support  \nMon–Fri, 9am–5pm ET", "annotations": []}]}], "tools": [], "usage": {"input_tokens": 2330, "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "output_tokens": 198, "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}, "total_tokens": 2528}, "_client_meta": {"latency_ms": 3939, "model": "openai/gpt-5.2"}}}
