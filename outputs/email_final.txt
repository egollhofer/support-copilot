Hi Maria,  

I’m sorry to hear one of the EVOO bottles in Order #OI-48372 arrived damaged and leaked. Since the item is unopened and was damaged during shipping, it may be eligible for a return and refund as long as the request is submitted within 7 days of delivery.  

We’ve received your photos—thank you. Next steps:  
1) We’ll review the photos and confirm whether the return is approved.  
2) If approved, we’ll send you return instructions. Refunds are issued to the original payment method and are typically processed within 5–10 business days.  

You also asked about a replacement: our current policy information covers returns/refunds for shipping damage, but doesn’t specify replacements. If you’d prefer a replacement, please reply and we’ll advise what we can do after reviewing the claim.  

Best regards,
