Hi Maria,

Thanks for reaching out, and I’m sorry one of the bottles in Order #OI-48372 arrived damaged and leaked. Since the bottle was unopened and the damage occurred during shipping, it may be eligible for a return/refund as long as the request is submitted within 7 days of delivery.

You’ve already done the right thing by including photos—thank you. To help us move this along, could you please reply confirming:
1) Which specific bottle/size was damaged, and whether any other bottles were affected.

Once we confirm the details, we’ll let you know the next steps. If approved, refunds are issued to the original payment method and are typically processed within 5–10 business days.

Best regards,  
Olivetto Imports Support Team
