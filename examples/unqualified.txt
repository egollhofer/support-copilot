Hi Olivetto Imports Support,

I received my order (Order #OI-49218) about two weeks ago and finally opened the bottle of extra virgin olive oil yesterday.

The oil tastes different from the one I ordered last time and the color is lighter than I expected. I was hoping to return it or get a refund since it doesn’t seem the same as before.

The bottle was sealed when it arrived and doesn’t appear to be damaged, but I’m not satisfied with the product.

Please let me know how I can send it back and get a refund.

Thanks,  
Daniel
