Hi Olivetto Imports Support Team,

I’m writing about my recent order, Order #OI-48372, which was delivered yesterday.

Unfortunately, when I opened the package, I noticed that one of the bottles of extra virgin olive oil had leaked during shipping. The bottle itself appears to be damaged, and some oil had soaked into the packaging.

The item was unopened when it arrived, and I have not used it. I’ve attached photos of the bottle and the packaging showing the damage.

Could you please let me know if this order is eligible for a refund or replacement, and what the next steps would be?

Thanks very much for your help.

Best regards,  
Maria Gonzalez
