## Sourcing & Harvest
Our olive oils are sourced from producers in:
- Italy (Tuscany, Puglia)
- Spain (Andalusia)
- Greece (Crete, Peloponnese)

Harvest details:
- Olives are harvested once per year during the fall season
- Exact harvest dates vary by region and climate conditions
- Oils are bottled shortly after pressing to preserve freshness

Because olive oil is an agricultural product, natural variation between harvests is expected.

## Flavor & Appearance Variability
Flavor, aroma, and color may vary due to:
- Olive variety
- Harvest timing
- Weather conditions
- Filtration method

Color differences (from bright green to golden yellow) do not indicate quality issues.

Taste notes may include:
- Fruity
- Peppery
- Grassy
- Mild bitterness

## Shelf Life & Freshness
Olive oil does not improve with age.

Recommended use:
- Best consumed within 12–18 months from bottling
- For optimal flavor, use within 6 months of opening

Storage recommendations:
- Store in a cool, dark place
- Avoid exposure to heat, light, and air
- Keep bottle tightly sealed when not in use

Refrigeration is not required and may cause cloudiness, which is harmless and reversible at room temperature.

## Cooking & Usage Guidelines

Our products are packaged to protect freshness:

Minor oil residue on the exterior of bottles may occur during transit and does not necessarily indicate leakage.
